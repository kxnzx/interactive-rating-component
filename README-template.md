### What I learned

- the styling of the radio buttons was a pain in the butt. At first I used appearance: none; with the input. This however still showed the space where the radio button was.

Last time I selected elements from the HTML Document Object Model (DOM) by it's specified id with the method getElementById(). For this solution I used the querySelector and the querySelectorAll. They all let you find HTML elements. It means that it will find the first element in the document.

- querySelector() = grabs any First element on the document, you can pass any valid css selector to grab any element you want
- querySelectorAll() = is used to select multiple elements at one time, this used if you want to grab a selection/list of elements.

When you have control over the document use:
These are better for speed and performance.

- getElementByClassName() = grabs the element only by the Class
- getElementByTagName() = grabs the element only by the Tag
- getElementById() = grabs the element only by the ID

It is important to understand that all the content in the page is made of nodes. There are 13 kinds of nodes, but I will focus only on 3 nodes.

- Tags are element nodes
- Content in the elements are text nodes
- attribute nodes

When one speaks of nodes it can be referered to elements or text. They are both nodes. These three are used the most:

- document.getElementById(id) - returns 1 element node
- document.querySelector(css) - returns 1 element node
- document.querySelectorAll(css) - returns 1 nodeList

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```
